Description
---
ofxTGWiiuse is an addon for openframeworks <https://github.com/openframeworks/openframeworks>.
It partially wraps the wiiuse library <https://github.com/rpavlik/wiiuse>, a cross platform c++ library that connects with nintedo wii controllers.

The current state is quite experimental and the addon is far from being finished. The buttons should work at least. 
Feel free to contribute.
